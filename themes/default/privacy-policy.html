  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    We, the developers of xClaim Wallet app, do not have access to your private information or actively track you in any way.
    You are never required to share any personal information to use the basic xClaim Wallet app, and your ethereum private keys are only ever accessible to your own device.
    If you choose to share your data with one of our third-party service providers, we make it easy for you to do so.
    For more detailed information, please see our Privacy Policy in its entirety below.
  </p>
  <h2>xClaim Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how personal information and tracking information is being used by xClaim Wallet. In the context of this document, “personal information” refers to information entered by our users into the xClaim Wallet app or xClaim Wallet website. “Tracking information” refers to information that could be used to record a user’s activity or otherwise tie their real-world identity to their activity online. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your information when collected through our app and website.
  </p>
  <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM OUR USERS?</h2>
  <p>
    Users may install and use the xClaim Wallet app on iPhone or Android without entering any personal information.
    We may offer additional services through our app, provided by third parties, which require the user to enter a certain amount of personal information in order to use the services.
    Users who do not wish to enter their personal information can simply refrain from accessing these third-party services. The xClaim Wallet app will continue to function like normal.
    Any emails we receive to our customer support platform, including the sender’s email address, will be visible to xClaim Wallet employees. Information received through the customer support platform will be considered confidential and will not be shared outside the company.
  </p>
  <h2>WHEN DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    Your personal information is only collected if and when you elect to use one of our third-party services.
  </p>
  <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    Any information a user enters when attempting to use a third party’s service will be shared with the third party, usually for KYC/AML purposes, and will fall under the terms and conditions of the third party’s privacy policy. The information will pass through xClaim Wallet servers on its way to the third party and anonymous statistics (but no personally identifiable information) may be saved for troubleshooting purposes. For details on how the third party will use your information, please see the third party’s privacy policy.
    The xClaim Wallet app uses your camera to scan QR codes. All processing of QR codes is done within your phone and no pictures or videos from your camera are shared with us or anyone else.
  </p>
  <h2>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    When you share personal information with us for the purpose of using one of our third-party services, your personal information is encrypted and transmitted to the third party.
    For your convenience, information you have entered may be encrypted by your device and stored on our servers, so that only your device is able to read the information. When you access our third-party services again in the future, this data can be downloaded by your device, decrypted, and transmitted to a third-party service on your behalf so you do not have to enter it again. Since this information is encrypted by your device, is it not viewable by xClaim Wallet employees or any third parties other than the ones you choose to share your data with.
    ethereum private keys are always encrypted by the secure hardware storage on a user’s device, meaning they are never accessible outside the device.
  </p>
  <h2>WHAT TRACKING INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
  <p>
    Our website does not use cookies, targeted advertising, or third-party behavioral tracking. We do not intentionally track users in any way.
    Users who visit our website or use our app may have their device’s I.P. address logged for the purpose of generating anonymous statistics or troubleshooting the performance of our web servers. Your I.P. address will not be used to track or identify you, but may be used to determine your geographic location to determine which of our services you are presented with.
    Users of our iPhone or Android app will receive an anonymous unique device id (UDID) for the purpose of identifying the device to xClaim Wallet servers. This UDID will not be tied to users’ identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when users of our third-party services access the services using multiple devices.
  </p>
  <h2>DO WE DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT TO THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
  <p>
    Your I.P. address and any personal information you enter while accessing a service provided by a third party will be shared with that third party. No personal information will be shared with a third party unless you explicitly sign up for services provided by that third party through the xClaim Wallet app.
    Your I.P. address may be visible to, and logged by, multiple infrastructure-related third parties, such as internet service providers (ISPs) or web hosting services.
